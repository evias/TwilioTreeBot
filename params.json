This package can be used for any\r\nApp at Parse.com in combination with a Twilio Account.\r\n\r\nA Demo of this App deployed to a Parse Hosting can be found at following\r\nURL : https://twiliotreebot.parseapp.com\r\n\r\nDeployment is very easy as the App can be deployed on the free Parse.com\r\ntiers. You'll find more informations about this here: https://www.parse.com/docs/cloudcode\r\n\r\nThis Feedback management module creates Twilio Subaccounts and Twilio Numbers\r\nfor every SignUp. Each of these signed up users can then easily send Feedback\r\nRequests to their Customers by SMS and see the Follow-Up of their Feedback\r\nRequests.\r\n\r\nWhen one of your Feedback Twilio phone numbers receives a SMS from one of the\r\ncustomers, the TwilioTreeBot App will answer to it by following this decision\r\ntree scheme :\r\n\r\n    1) Feedback Request SMS to your Customer\r\n      Example: \"Do you think we did a good job? Yes or No\"\r\n    2) Answer from Customer to your Signed Up user's Twilio number\r\n      2a) YES: Thanks SMS to your Customer\r\n          Example: \"So happy to hear that :)\"\r\n      2b) NO: Question SMS to your Customer\r\n          Example: \"We are sorry to hear that.\"\r\n      2c) anything else: Error SMS to your Customer\r\n          Example: \"can you please answer with yes or no.\"\r\n    3) Any other follow-up messages are treated like Feedback from Customers\r\n      and will respond to the number with a Thanks SMS.\r\n      Example: \"Thanks for the feedback\"\r\n\r\nThe point of this App is to provide an easy to install and easy to use\r\nFeedback Management Application in the cloud. The only requirements for this\r\nApp to function are a Parse App on which the CloudCode is deployed and a\r\nTwilio account for which creating Subaccounts and SmsEnabled numbers is\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nPlease make sure to have the Parse Command-Line Tools installed and configured\r\nas described here: https://www.parse.com/docs/cloudcode/guide#command-line\r\n\r\nFor this installation example I will assume that you have already created\r\na Parse App with the name \"myFeedbackApp\".\r\n\r\nFirst thing to do to be able to install the TwilioTreeBot App is to clone\r\nthe git repository with the source code.\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/evias/TwilioTreeBot.git\r\n    $ cd TwilioTreeBot\r\n\r\nNow that you have the source code, you will see a public/ directory and a\r\ncloud/ directory. These two directories are important for the CloudCode API\r\nprovided by Parse.com. See following link for more details about CloudCode\r\nApps on Parse: https://www.parse.com/docs/cloudcode/guide\r\n\r\nThe last step of the installation is to deploy the application to the Parse\r\nApp \"myFeedbackApp\" you created earlier. The command-line tools from Parse\r\nmake this process very easy:\r\n\r\n    $ parse new -a myFeedbackApp\r\n    $ parse deploy myFeedbackApp\r\n\r\nYour Feedback Management app is now online !\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n    * jQuery 1.11\r\n    * Parse CloudCode\r\n    * uses Twilio API version 2010-04-01\r\n\r\n### Hints / Advices\r\nUsing git, when you will modify your .parse.local file of the clone in order\r\nto configure your parse command line tools to use your own Parse App, git will\r\nsee the .parse.local file as modified. To avoid having to communicate my Parse\r\nApp details, I use following command to mark the .parse.local file unchanged:\r\n\r\n    $ git update-index [--assume-unchanged|--no-assume-unchanged]\r\n\r\n### Git Branching\r\n2 git branches will usually be updated in this repository, being the branch\r\n*master* for releases (see git tags) and the branch *develop* for development\r\nof features. Hotfixes might branch from *master* but will usually be tackled\r\nfrom a *develop* branch or sub-branch.\r\n\r\n### Support / Contact\r\nYou can contact me anytime at my e-mail address and I will be glad to answer\r\nany type of questions related to this project.\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome if you see anything missing or have detected a\r\nbug, want to develop a new API class, or whatever, I will be glad to respond\r\nto pull requests!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nGreg\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
